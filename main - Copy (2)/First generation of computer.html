<h1><font color="red">First Generation Of Computer: Vacuum Tubes (1940â€“1956)</h1></font color>
<CENTER><img src="1.JPG" border=5></CENTER><br>
<h2><b>The period of first generation was 1946 - 1954. Computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for Central Processing Unit.The first electronic computer, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and calculator) was developed in 1947 at the University of Pennsylvania, USA. This machine had vacuum tubes as switching devices. Von Neumann introduced the concept of stored program by around the same time and the first digital computer using program, EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator), was announced in 1949.
They were very large in size, consumed lot of power dnd emitted too much of heat. They required to be housed in large air-conditioned rooms.
During this period, computer programming was mainly done in machine language. The user had to be both an electronics expert and a programmer to use the computer for any task.</h2></b>

<h1><font color="red">Vacuum Tube </h1></font color>
<img src="vt.JPG" align=right border=5><br>
<h2><p>Alternatively referred to as an electron tube or valve and first developed by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904. The vacuum tube is a glass tube with its gas removed, creating a vacuum. Vacuum tubes contain electrodes for controlling electron flow and were used in early computers as a switch or an amplifier. The picture shows a collection of different vacuum tubes used with different devices.</p>

<p>By using vacuum tubes instead of a mechanical relays computers could move away from mechanical switching and speed up the switching on and off the flow of electrons. Vacuum tubes were also used in radios, televisions, radar equipment, and telephone systems during the first half of the 1900s.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, the transistor started to replace the vacuum tube as vacuum tubes were larger in size, fragile like a light bulb, and expensive. As computing devices started to become smaller in size, transistors were more ideal to use due to their smaller size as well.</p>

<p>Today, vacuum tubes are primarily used in high-end audio equipment, preferred by some audiophiles as an alternative to digital systems</P></h2>



<H1><font color="red">Advantages Of The First Generation Of The Computer</h1></font color>
<ol ><h2>
<LI>The computer was very fast to calculate.</li>
