<h2>Generation in computer terminology is a change in technology a computer is/was being used. Initially, the generation term was used to distinguish between varying hardware technologies. Nowadays, generation includes both hardware and software, which together make up an entire computer system</h2></hr>

<h1><font color="red">First Generation Of Computer(1940-1956)</h1></font color>
<center>
<img src="1.JPG" border=5 ></center><br>
<h2>First generation computers were powered by thousands of vacuum tubes or thermionic valves and their memory was stored on magnetic storage devices such as magnetic tapes and drums. Most data was entered onto the computer via pucnh cards or paper tape. Output was in the same form as human operators had to set switches before a program could run. </h2>

<p><h1><font color="red">Characteristics of First Generation of Computers</h1></font color>
<ul><h2>
<li>Use of vacuum tubes to make circuits.</li>
<li>Use of magnetic drums.</li>
<li>Use of machine language and symbols in instructions.</li>
<li>Very small amount of storage space.</li>
<li>Use of punch cards as I/O devices.</li>
<li>Huge in size and poor in mobility.</li>
<li>Very slow and less reliable output.</li>
<li>Use of high electricity.</li></ul></h2></p>

<h1><font color="red">Second Generation Of Computer(1956-1963)</h1></font color>
<center><img src="2.JPG" border=5 height=700 ></center><br>
<p><h2>The invention of transistor paved the way for the development of computer. The transistor replaced the large, cumbersome vacuum tube based tube first generation computers. As a result, the size of machine began to slim down ever since. Magnetic cores were used as primary memory and magnetic disks and tapes were used as secondary storage device. However,they still relied on punched cards for input printout for output.</P><br>

Assembly language,in the form of alphanumeric; that is mnemonics, was used for the program. As a result, programming languages such as FORTRAN (Fromula Translator), ALGOL (Algorithmic Language) and COBOL(Common Business-Oriented Language) also came into existence in this period.</h2>

<h1><font color="red">Characteristics of Second Generation of Computers</h1></font color>
<ul><h2>
<li>Use of transistors</li>
<li>Magnetic memory and magnetic storage disks</li>
<li>High speed I/O devices</li>
<li>Invention and use of high level languages such as Fortran and Cobol. </li> 
<li>Reduced size</li>
<li>Solution to heat generation</li>
<li>Communication by using telephone line</li>
<li>Improvement of speed and reliability</li></ul></h2>

<h1><font color="red">Third Generation Of Computer(1964-Early 1970s)</h1></font color>
<CENTER><img src="3.JPG"border=5 HEIGHT=500></CENtER><br>
<h2>Despite the fact that transistors were clearly an improvement over the vacuum tube, they still generated a great deal of heat, which damaged the computer's sensitive internal parts.<br>
Scientists later managed to fit even more components on a single chip, called a semiconductor that is integrated were squeezed onto the chip. Another third-generation development included the use of an operating system that allowed machine to run many different programs at  once with a central program that monitored and coordinated the computer's memory</h2>

<h1><font color="red">Characteristics of Third Generation of Computers</h1></font color>
<ul><h2>
<li>Use of Integrated Circuits (IC) instead of transistors</li>
<li>Use of Semi-conductor memory</li>
<li>Small size than previous generation computers</li>
<li>Use of magnetic storage devices</li>
<li>Improved faster operations and more dependable output</li>
<li>Use of mini computers</li>
<li><li>Use of monitors and line printers</li>
<li>Use of high level programming languages</li>
<li>Less expensive than 2nd generation computers</li>
<li> Less expensive maintenance cost.</li></ul></h2>

<h1><font color="red">Fourth Generation Of Computer(Early 1970s-Till Date)</h1></font color>
<center><img src="00.JPEG" border=5></center><br>
<h2>Fourth Generation computers are the modern day latest computers.The size dramatically slims down with the improvement in the integrated circuits. Very large Scale integration(VLSI) and Ultra large scale integration(ULSI) ensured that millions of computers could be fit into samll chip.It reduces the size and price of the computers, at the same time increase the power, efficiency and reliability of the computer. Fourth generation computers use VLSI as chief components.  </h2>

<h1><font color="red">Characteristics of Fourth Generation of Computers</h1></font color>
<ul><h2>
<li>Microprocessor based system that uses Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. </li>
<li>Microcomputers became the cheapest at this generation.</li>
<li>Hand-held computer devices became more popular and affordable</li>
<li>Networking between the systems was developed and became of every day use in this generation.</li>
<li>Storage of memory and other storage devices has increased in big amount.</li>
<li>Outputs are now more reliable and accurate.</li>
<li>Processing power or speed has increased enormously. </li>
<li>With increment in the capacity of the storage systems large programs were started to be in use</li>
<li>Great improvement in the hardware helped great improvement in the output in screen, paper etc.</li>
<li>Size of the computer devices became such small that even desktop computers were easily movable along with portable computers such as laptops etc</li></ul></h2>

<h1><font color="red">Fifth Generation of Computers(Present and Beyond)</h1></font color>
<center><img src="5.JPG" border=5></center><br>
<h2>The computes of this generation are still in development stage; scientists are trying to do so since 1990. The computers of this generation use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and bio-chips as memory device sp that they can think and decide like a human being. Bio-chips are made up Biological orgnism and protein fibres obtained  from the living organism. That os the reason why these computers have the power of sense, logic, decision making capability and parallel processing. Furture developments in computer  hardware and software design  may even push up to produce computers far more powerful than those in the current use.<p>
predictably, such a computer in near future will be able to communication in nature language with its user, store vast knowledge databases, search rapidly through these databases, thereby making intelligent inferences, drawing logical conclusions, processing images and 'seeing' objects exactly the way that humans do.</h2>

<h1><font color="red">Characteristics of Fifth Generation of Computers</h1></font color>
<ul><h2>
<li>Multi-processor based system: Currently we use one processor per CPU though there are special computers already in use with parallel computing but those are very limited and not complete.</li>
<li>Use of Artificial Intelligence: AI is also in use already, but still it is in development. In fifth generation computers, we expect to see AI applied in everywhere, from navigating to browsing, from everyday word-excel sheet processing to heavy duty image processing and video analyzing etc. AI will become personal assistant, AI will automate almost every aspect computing.</li>
<li>Use of optical fiber in circuits</li>
<li>Development of the elements of programs</li>
<li>Automated audio in any language to control the workflow of the computer</li>
<li>Magnetic enabled chips</li> 
<li>Huge development of storage: Already we have SSD storage which is way faster than HDD, and a few other technologies under development, thus we expect to faster and larger storage in fifth generation computers.</li>
<li>More powerful micro and macro computers</li>
<li>Development of enormous powers with AI</li></ul></h2>
